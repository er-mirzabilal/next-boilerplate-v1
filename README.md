Next.js Boilerplate
Welcome to the Next.js Boilerplate! This is a starting point for creating web applications using Next.js, a popular React-based framework for building server-side rendered applications.

Getting Started
To get started with this boilerplate, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine:

 
git clone https://github.com/<repository-name>.git

Next, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:


cd next-js-boilerplate
npm install

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can start the development server by running:


npm run dev

This will start the development server and you should be able to access the application at http://localhost:3000.
